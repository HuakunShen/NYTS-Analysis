# US Income Analysis

In order to do an unbiased and valid analysis, I will need an unbiased and large-enough dataset. Income is a good choice. I am interested in the trend of household income for different genders, race, ages, in different period of time and see if special social events (such as covid19) occured could affect the income of people or a group of people. 

I haven't decided which dataset to use, but there are plenty of choices.

https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-families.html (Links to an eternal site.) seems to be a good choice containing historical data for many scenarios (work experience, race).
